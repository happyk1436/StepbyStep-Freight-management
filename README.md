# StepbyStep-Freight-management
Project Info  1. Reqeust you to try to understand the dataset, remove any missing values that are present in the dataset.  2. You have four datasets --> Markets, equiptment codes, spotfreight data and Region lookup data. 3. Remove any NA's that are there in the datasets.  4. If possible , see if you can create new features from the datasets i.e using the time dataset.  5. Again the Equipment type and meaning are give separately in two different datasets. Merge the datasets to create a new column 6. Check if NA values are available.  7. Check if basic exploratory data analysis can be done.  (https://www.r-bloggers.com/exploratory-data-analysis-useful-r-functions-for-exploring-a-data-frame/)  8. Also there is zip code in the dataset. Lookup zip code from other datasets and merge them using the region code and market codes (other 2 files). 9. See if you can perform basic exploratory analysis and then try to build models and perform some analysis. Check for missing values etc...  10. Pick the model that is better than others and explain the model.
